PEP 409 | wrote_pep| discussion | However, I may switch to other things based on external events e g. the email I just sent proposing acceptance of PEP 3144 was based on Georg posting Peter's latest draft, the PEP 408 discussions a short while back that were prompted by Eli following up on article I'd written some time ago with a full PEP , or because I want to get them done while they're clear in my mind e g. the time I spent last weekend writing up my summary of the text file processing in Python 3 Unicode discussion was time that I had previously planned to spend working on either PEP 394, which had already been resolved by then, or on PEP 409 .|I also had an illuminating off-list discussion with the PEP 407 authors and the 3.4 RM that I want to write up as a new PEP before the language summit in a few week 's time -LRB- even though I wo n't be there in person -RRB- .

PEP null | | discussion | |The ordering of the MONTONIC_CLOCKS list would express the result of that discussion , in that the `` better '' clocks come first .
PEP null | | reason | |Sure , seems reasonable .
PEP null | | reason | |Once you start requesting precision -LRB- a totally reasonable desire , BTW -RRB- you also want to request degree of slew -LRB- since `` steady '' is a tunabe term -RRB- and so forth .
PEP null | | _steady | |haypo_steady = get_clock -LRB- MONOTONIC | STEADY , STEADY , MONOTONIC , REALTIME -RRB- # try to get a monotonic and steady clock , # or fallback to a steady clock , # or fallback to a monotonic clock , # or fallback to the system clock
PEP null | | _steady | |On Windows , haypo_steady should give GetTickCount -LRB- MONOTONIC | STEADY -RRB- and haypo_perf_counter should give QueryPerformanceCounter -LRB- MONOTONIC | HIGHRES -RRB- .
PEP null | | discussion | |but this is my exact objection to the `` just provide hires -LRB- -RRB- and steady -LRB- -RRB- and/or monotonic -LRB- -RRB- '' API ; the discussion to date is littered with `` I ca n't imagine wanting to do X '' style remarks .
PEP null | | rant | |System nanoTime -LRB- -RRB- of Java has few garantee : `` Returns the current value of the most precise available system timer , in nanoseconds .
PEP null | | rant | |System.nanoTime -LRB- -RRB- of Java has few garantee : `` Returns the current value of the most precise available system timer , in nanoseconds .
PEP null | | rant | |System.nanoTime -LRB- -RRB- of Java has few garantee : `` Returns the current value of the most precise available system timer , in nanoseconds .
PEP null | | debate | |Otherwise they are steady , if the runner 's speed is always sufficiently close to the flag speed -LRB- this threshold and the criteria for measuring it as subject to debate , forming policy -RRB- .
PEP null | | reason | |Well , yes , but even that 's not enough -- it needs to go forward at a reasonably constant rate , otherwise it 's just as useless .
PEP null | | reason | || > | This is the original reason for the original defect -LRB- issue 10278 -RRB- | > | unix ' clock -LRB- -RRB- does n't actually provide a clock in this sense , | > | it provides a resource usage metric .
PEP null | | say | || > | > Yeah :--LRB- Its help says `` Return the CPU time or real time since -LSB- ... -RSB- '' .
PEP null | | say | |This page : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683223%28v=vs.85%29.aspx says `` 100-nanosecond time units '' .

PEP null | | rant | |In practice , most uses of `` monotonic '' with respect to clocks actually refer to a stronger set of guarantees , as described under <clock_monotonic>
PEP null | | pronounce | |-LRB- Unfortunately , it 's somewhat awkward to pronounce , easily confused with `` monotonic '' , and unfamiliar : maybe only musicians will have intuition for it .

PEP null | | say | |If we 're using the same definitions we discussed offline , where resolution is the units the clock call underneath works in for example , nanoseconds precision is the effective precision of the results , for example milliseconds I 'd say people would care if they knew , and mostly care about precision .
PEP null | | issues | |As usual there are issues of average vs. worst case , different resolution precision accuracy over the instrument 's range , etc. which need to be considered in reporting values for these properties .

PEP null | | controversial | |However , what I read in this thread is that the PEP protagonist does n't feel qualified or motivated to maintain the glossary , and others posting that surely we agree on what we 're talking about even though the definitions in the PEP are controversial and at least one resolution is close to meaningless in actual use .

PEP null | | stalled | |How expensive depends on a lot of things decides before python was installed .
PEP null | | rant | |Is it because the functions used in practice -LRB- on a modern OS -RRB- to retrieve timestamps do n't guarantee to ignore changes to the system clock ?
PEP null | | stalled | |How expensive depends on a lot of things decides before python was installed .
PEP null | | say | |As I say above , that is so far away from what `` steady '' implies that this is a misnomer .
PEP null | | rant | |In addition to that , you may have the requirement that the monotonic clock also should not be able to jump forward , but if I understand things correctly , most current OS 's will not guarantee this .

PEP 453 | wrote_pep| discussion | That's basically why I wrote this note I'm hoping that it's a bit clearer now why the pip team are sensitive to strong statements like the PEP process applies to pip which are oversimplifications of a rather complex and still evolving relationship between the core CPython and PyPA teams.|There has been a fair bit of frustration in this discussion , and that has resulted in some statements that have maybe been a little more black and white than they should have been .

PEP 459 | draft| say | The don't rely on it unless the container version says it's OK to do so caution in the PEP is primarily because wheels already ship with pydist json metadata emitted based on an earlier draft version of the spec from before I gutted it and moved the optional sections out to PEP 459 as standard extension modules, which is also the change that did the most damage when it came to invalidating the current jsonschema definition .|That 's the timeline for the formal definition , in practice `` drop pydist json in the existing directory '' as PEP 426 suggests is a fairly safe bet as to what those specs are going to say .

PEP 308 | updated| reviewing | That issue was resolved by simply deferring to a BDFL best judgment call .|The decision was validated by reviewing how the syntax fared when applied throughout the standard library -LRB- this review approximates a sampling of real-world use cases , across a variety of applications , written by a number of programmers with diverse backgrounds -RRB- .
PEP null | | reason | |Adding an int-specific Enum class eliminates a lot of the use cases for a `` named object '' feature , which is the main reason I 'm trying to hold out for the more general functionality - I still have hope that we 'll strike on a syntax for named assignments that is clear enough and clean enough that none of the core devs actively oppose it .

PEP 202 | accepted| response | Had generators already been in place when list comprehensions were accepted, the yield option might have been incorporated from the start.|Author response : I 've studied several syntactical variations and concluded that the brackets are essential for : - teachability -LRB- it 's like a list comprehension -RRB- - set-off -LRB- yield applies to the comprehension not the enclosing function -RRB- - substitutability -LRB- list comprehensions can be made lazy just by adding yield -RRB-
PEP 202 | accepted| response | Had generators already been in place when list comprehensions were accepted, the yield option might have been incorporated from the start.|What I like best about generator comprehensions is that I can design using list comprehensions and then easily switch to a generator by adding yield in response to scalability requirements when the list comprehension produces too large of an intermediate result .

PEP 247 | accepted| reason | Changing the C API so that Paths are accepted where necessary was the suggested solution, although the PEP at the time of writing the summary still subclasses Path from string.|Jason explained that the reason that there is so much cruft in his path module is that the design is heavily skewed toward people already familiar with the existing standard library equivalents .
PEP 247 | accepted| debate | Changing the C API so that Paths are accepted where necessary was the suggested solution, although the PEP at the time of writing the summary still subclasses Path from string.|The debate centred on whether subclassing string was the best way to do this or not .

PEP 308 | wrote_pep| interest | 1 I don't want conditional expressions added to python with any syntax 2 I don't necessarily object to conditional expressions, but I don't like and wouldn't support any syntax proposed so far 3 I'm in support of PEP 308 as written, but I wouldn't support any of the other proposed syntaxes 4 I'd support PEP 308 as written, and I prefer it to any of the proposed alternatives, but I could support some of the alternatives as well 5 I would prefer one of the proposed alternate syntaxes to the original PEP, but if it comes down to just yes no on PEP 308, I would vote yes 6 I would support one or more of the proposed alternate syntaxes, but not PEP 308 as written|This can be looked at in a few interesting ways :

PEP 355 | rejected| issues | Also, it's definitely the kind of kitchen sink design that got PEP 355 rejected which often makes sense for a third party lib even when it doesn't for a stdlib module .|Also , because its Path subclasses str , it does n't have the same usability issues you can pass a Path straight to json loads , for example , although of course that gives it different usability issues e g. , inherited methods like Path count are an obvious attractive nuisance .

PEP null | | stalled | |But that 's not what you want you want it to use the system installed Twisted and zope interface , and pycrypto , and pytz , etc etc and just install PANTS into your local environment .
PEP null | | stalled | |No files will conflict , but it would be helpful for the package installation tool to have an API to inspect both the system package installation and any other places where packages have been installed in order to make a decision about how it needs to satisfy its dependencies .

PEP null | | arguments | |The returned strings could then be made to round trip as arguments , by having functions that take hostname arguments attempt to encode them using ASCII surrogateescape first before trying IDNA encoding .
PEP null | | say | |POSIX says of the name lookup functions that `` in many cases '' they are implemented by the Domain Name System , not that they always are , so a name intended for lookup need not be ASCII-only either .
PEP null | | reviewed | |Before , if the submitter contributed a patch , the patch was just unreviewed for a long time , unless one of the committers picked it up .

PEP 393 | accepted| discussion | I'm not going to require that IronPython or Jython have string objects that support O 1 indexing of code points, even assuming PEP 393 gets accepted CPython will have them.|See the ongoing python-dev discussion on this topic . -RRB-
PEP null | | obsolete | |Closing this bug as PEP 393 is now implemented and makes so-called `` narrow builds '' obsolete .
PEP 394 | wrote_pep| discussion | However, I may switch to other things based on external events e g. the email I just sent proposing acceptance of PEP 3144 was based on Georg posting Peter's latest draft, the PEP 408 discussions a short while back that were prompted by Eli following up on article I'd written some time ago with a full PEP , or because I want to get them done while they're clear in my mind e g. the time I spent last weekend writing up my summary of the text file processing in Python 3 Unicode discussion was time that I had previously planned to spend working on either PEP 394, which had already been resolved by then, or on PEP 409 .|I also had an illuminating off-list discussion with the PEP 407 authors and the 3.4 RM that I want to write up as a new PEP before the language summit in a few week 's time -LRB- even though I wo n't be there in person -RRB- .

PEP 409 | wrote_pep| discussion | However, I may switch to other things based on external events e g. the email I just sent proposing acceptance of PEP 3144 was based on Georg posting Peter's latest draft, the PEP 408 discussions a short while back that were prompted by Eli following up on article I'd written some time ago with a full PEP , or because I want to get them done while they're clear in my mind e g. the time I spent last weekend writing up my summary of the text file processing in Python 3 Unicode discussion was time that I had previously planned to spend working on either PEP 394, which had already been resolved by then, or on PEP 409 .|I also had an illuminating off-list discussion with the PEP 407 authors and the 3.4 RM that I want to write up as a new PEP before the language summit in a few week 's time -LRB- even though I wo n't be there in person -RRB- .

PEP null | | reason | |A number of reasons -LRB- not exhaustive -RRB- :

PEP 416 | rejected| interest | The PEP 416 was rejected, so there is no builtin frozendict type, but it looks like the dictproxy type will be exposed as a public type.|CPython expects __ builtins __ to be a dict , but it is interesting to be able to use another type .

PEP null | | interest | |The idea of flags attached to each clock is interesting , but I do n't like the need of different list of clocks .
PEP null | | interest | |Under the assumption that all return some sort of timestamp and take no parameters , a local name will be assigned to the clock of interest :
PEP null | | interest | |There would not even be a need to document the actual names of the APIs for each individual clock , except that probably some folks would want to directly code them , especially if they are not interested in cross-platform work .
PEP null | | interest | |There would not even be a need to document the actual names of the APIs for each individual clock , except that probably some folks would want to directly code them , especially if they are not interested in cross-platform work .
PEP null | | discussion | |We 've just had pages upon pages of discussion about what clock to offer for the rather bald monotonic -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- et al -RRB- calls .
PEP null | | discussion | |The ordering of the MONTONIC_CLOCKS list would express the result of that discussion , in that the `` better '' clocks come first .
PEP null | | reason | |Sure , seems reasonable .
PEP null | | reason | |Once you start requesting precision a totally reasonable desire , BTW you also want to request degree of slew since steady is a tunabe term and so forth .
PEP null | | _steady | |haypo_steady = get_clock -LRB- MONOTONIC | STEADY , STEADY , MONOTONIC , REALTIME -RRB- # try to get a monotonic and steady clock , # or fallback to a steady clock , # or fallback to a monotonic clock , # or fallback to the system clock
PEP null | | _steady | |On Windows , haypo_steady should give GetTickCount -LRB- MONOTONIC | STEADY -RRB- and haypo_perf_counter should give QueryPerformanceCounter -LRB- MONOTONIC | HIGHRES -RRB- .
PEP null | | discussion | |but this is my exact objection to the `` just provide hires -LRB- -RRB- and steady -LRB- -RRB- and/or monotonic -LRB- -RRB- '' API ; the discussion to date is littered with `` I ca n't imagine wanting to do X '' style remarks .

PEP null | | debate | |Otherwise they are steady , if the runner 's speed is always sufficiently close to the flag speed -LRB- this threshold and the criteria for measuring it as subject to debate , forming policy -RRB- .
PEP null | | reason | |Well , yes , but even that 's not enough it needs to go forward at a reasonably constant rate , otherwise it 's just as useless .

PEP null | | rant | |In practice , most uses of `` monotonic '' with respect to clocks actually refer to a stronger set of guarantees , as described under <clock_monotonic>
