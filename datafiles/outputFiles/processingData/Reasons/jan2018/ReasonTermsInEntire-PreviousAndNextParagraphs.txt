PEP 335 | proposal| support | As shown in the basic example above , the PEP further proposes the addition of builtin exists and missing circuit breakers that provide conditional branching based on whether or not an object is None , but return the original object rather than the existence checking wrapper when the expression evaluation short circuits .|To properly support logical negation of circuit breakers , a new `` __ not __ `` protocol method would also be introduced allowing objects to control the result of `` not obj `` expressions .

PEP 492 | proposal| discussion | PEP 492 proposes a quite simple and elegant solution for these issues .|Most of the technical discussion about the PEP is on getting the details right so that users wo n't have to worry about them , and can instead just continue to write \* almost \* sequential code when using the asyncio package -LRB- or some other framework that offers an event loop integrated with coroutines -RRB- .
PEP 492 | accepted| discussion | We may be able to do this for 3.5.1 since PEP 492 was accepted provisionally , see https mail.python.orgpipermailpython dev2015 May139844.html although it 's still a pretty big new feature .|We should also have more discussion -LRB- on python-dev , IMO , not just in the issue -RRB- about whether we want this at all -- I find it questionable to mix await and threads , as I have said several times in the discussion about Nick Coghlan 's proposal to introduce helper functions with a similar function .
PEP 493 | proposal| support | Rather than allowing a plethora of mutually incompatibile migration techniques to bloom , this PEP proposes two alternative approaches that redistributors may take when addressing these problems .|These designs are being proposed as a recommendation for redistributors , rather than as new upstream features , as they are needed purely to support legacy environments migrating from older versions of Python 2.7 .

PEP 493 | proposal| support | Yeah , I think you are correct in your understanding of what actual changes to the python distrribution are being proposed for redistributors in the PEP .|So that means that sites still ca n't rely on this long-term -LRB- but their long term would extend to the lifetime of their vendor supporting python2 rather than when their vendor updated to 2.7.9 + -RRB- and also that developers ca n't depend on this if they 're developing portable code .

PEP 493 | proposal| majority | Rather than allowing a plethora of mutually incompatibile migration techniques to bloom , this PEP proposes an additional feature to be added to Python 2.7.12 to make it easier to revert a process to the past behavior of skipping certificate validation in HTTPS client modules .|They are not being proposed as new features for Python 3 , as it is expected that the vast majority of client applications affected by this problem without the ability to update the application itself will be Python 2 applications .

PEP 3106 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes to just eliminate all that annoyance by making the iterator based APIs work again in Python 3.5 .|The view based APIs that were added to Python 2.7 do n't actually help with the transition process , as they do n't exist in Python 3 and hence are n't part of the common subset of Python 2 and Python 3 , and also are n't supported by most Python 2 mappings -LRB- including the collection ABCs -RRB- .
