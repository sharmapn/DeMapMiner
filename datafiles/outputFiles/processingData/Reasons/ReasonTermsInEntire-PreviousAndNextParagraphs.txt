PEP 319 | accepted| discussion | The PEP has been approved in principle by the BDFL , but there are The PEP was approved in principle by the BDFL , but there were still a couple of implementation details to be worked out see the section on Open Issues .|Modified : Log : Update with outcome of recent python-dev discussions

PEP 321 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes adding a family of predefined parsing function for several commonly used date and time formats , and a facility for generic parsing .|There 's no support for parsing strings in various formats and returning a corresponding instance of one of the types .
PEP 323 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes another idea that will , in some important cases , !|This PEP suggests that some iterator types should support being copied !
PEP 325 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes that the built in generator type implement a close method and destruction semantics , such that the restriction on yield placement can be lifted , expanding the applicability of generators .|The typical idiom for timely release is not supported , a yield statement is not allowed in the try clause of a try-finally statement inside a generator .
PEP 325 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes that generators should grow such a close method with such semantics that the example could be rewritten as|# Today this is not valid Python : yield is not allowed between # try and finally , and generator type instances support no # close method .
PEP 328 | proposal| discussion | The PEP below proposes a solution along with a counter solution .|Some of you might remember a discussion that took place on this list about not being able to execute a script contained in a package that used relative imports -LRB- read the PEP if you do n't quite get what I am talking about -RRB- .

PEP 0 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes to improve the situation by defining a simple and pythonic image protocol interface that can be hopefully accepted and implemented by existing image classes inside and outside the standard library without breaking backward compatibility with their existing user bases .|+ + The inclusion in the standard library of a class that provides basic + image manipulation functionality and implements the new protocol is + also proposed , together with a mixin class that helps adding support + for the protocol to existing image classes .
PEP 0 | proposal| support | However , this PEP also proposes that a new feature be added to pkg resources , before being added to the stdlib .|Currently , + `` pkg_resources `` is only available through installing the entire + `` setuptools `` distribution , but it does not depend on any other part + of setuptools ; in effect , it comprises the entire runtime support + library for Python Eggs , and is independently useful .
PEP 0 | proposal| support | However , this PEP also proposes that a new feature be added to pkg resources , before being added to the stdlib .|+ + In addition , with one feature addition , this module could support + easy bootstrap installation of several Python package management + tools , including `` setuptools `` , `` workingenv `` , and `` zc.buildout `` .

PEP 493 | proposal| support | Yeah , I think you are correct in your understanding of what actual changes to the python distrribution are being proposed for redistributors in the PEP .|So that means that sites still ca n't rely on this long-term -LRB- but their long term would extend to the lifetime of their vendor supporting python2 rather than when their vendor updated to 2.7.9 + -RRB- and also that developers ca n't depend on this if they 're developing portable code .

PEP 3131 | accepted| support | PEP 3131 has been accepted after long debates , and I 'll pronounce that supporting non ASCII module names is a direct consequence of having it accepted .|Of course , there may be limitations with respect to operating systems , and in the way Python modules integrate with the file system - but that non-ASCII module names must be supported is really out of question .
PEP 3131 | proposal| feedback | In summary , this PEP proposes to allow non ASCII letters as identifiers in Python .|PEP 1 specifies that PEP authors need to collect feedback from the community .
PEP 3131 | proposal| feedback | In summary , this PEP proposes to allow non ASCII letters as identifiers in Python .|I believe this PEP differs from other Py3k PEPs in that it really requires feedback from people with different cultural background to evaluate it fully - most other PEPs are culture-neutral .
PEP 3134 | proposal| support | This PEP proposes to implement context and cause suppression differently .|In order to support `` raise ... from None `` -LRB- which would set `` __ cause __ `` to `` None `` -RRB- we need a different default value for `` __ cause __ `` .
